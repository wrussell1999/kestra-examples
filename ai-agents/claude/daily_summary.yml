Break these into 2 separate sections that are clear summaries for the user to help them plan their day. These sections will be centred to the middle of the email but the text inside will remain left aligned. They will receive this first thing in the morning. This is only the body of the email so no need to add a subject. Add 'Good morning! Here is your daily digest:' at the start. At the bottom, just put Daily Digest."
